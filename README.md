# Web_Application_Music_App
The repo contains a complete implementation of a Music App web application. It consists of both back-end and front-end.

The project aims to design and implement a ReST API for accessing artists, albums, tracks and genres from the Free Music Archive (https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.01840, https://github.com/mdeff/fma ) as well as creating custom lists of tracks. Also create a client (front-end) interface for interacting with the above API.

The web application consists of a front-end implemented using HTML, CSS and JavaScript and a back-end API implemented using Node.js.

* Front-end Framework used: Angular
* Back-end Framework used: Node.js
* Database used: MongoDB
